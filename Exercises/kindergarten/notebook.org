* Context
An experiment was conducted in a kindergarten of the Grenoble region. 
Some of the teachers were trained to teach with an alternative pedagogy. 
The children of the school were divided into two groups, the first group following a classical pedagogy, 
the second the alternative pedagogy. The children were followed up over three years (2012-2014), 
and their scores are given below for the three successive years, when they were in the petite, 
moyenne and grande section. The score is to be understood as a measure of competences, 
9 being the largest value possible and 0 the smallest. The same test was given every year.

* Data
Initially, the data we were provided is contained in a pdf file ; two tables, each representing the data
collected for a group (see [[https://github.com/oulkaid/MoSIG-SMPE-Labs/tree/main/Exercises/R_manipulation/sections_scores_pdf/exercise.pdf][pdf file]]). This is definetly not the best format to work with data. So we wanted to create
a csv file, unless that a copy/past from the pdf file doesn't give the convenient structure. We used some 
R script to manage to do this (see [[https://github.com/oulkaid/MoSIG-SMPE-Labs/blob/main/Exercises/R_manipulation/sections_scores_pdf/manipulation.org][Building dataframe from pdf]]).
