* October, 21
- Reviewing the homework about footSize=f(Mistakes)
- Bars mainly used for catefories : A, B, C, etc.
- The importance of multiplying pictures, visualization.
- Inference : split the photo into two ; the original data + predctition plot (linear regression)
- There is a test to verify ; correlation Vs. Causation.
- What is the message behind ; choices.
- Confidence Interval !
- Which precision ?
- Think about how to share data ? csv. !
- "Regular expressions" !
- Make things explicit as much as possible, otherwise.. bad things might happen.
- Choose the type of variables/features in the data.
- Alternatives to .csv : json, yaml, 
- Pay attention to the semantics of the variables : range, missing values, etc.
  - example : 0.0 Vs. NaN (Not a Number), NA (Not Available)
- Pay attention to the types with respect to the used proramming language. 
- Knowing the NA is super important, to compute the "mean", etc.
- digital object identifier ("doi") !
- "binder" ! : the idea of docker merged with github.
  - also useful for inspection / letting other be capable of running my code. (Vs. Jupyter).

** R
- available data frames : mtcars
- mtcars$mpg + 2 : many possible operations to export data in R
- mean(mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 20 & cars$carb==4,]$wt) : example of data exportation in R
- library(dplyr) : tools for efficiently manipulate datasets in R.
- a bit strange ; R have acces to the name of the variable !! not ever seen in any other langauage.
- R is more functional than Python (which more declarative/iterative)
- troncate computation ; know when/where to save milestones in calculation.
- Allways comment the choices that are made. when filtering, creating virtual data groups, etc.
  - Semantics.

** Rmd
 - Documentation

** Open Science
- www.go-fair.org : an international non-profit initiative
  - open access, open data, open code, 
  - Reprocucibility
+ Merkle trees, Merkle DAG
+ How does git work ?
+ Finding archived public code from github on "software heritage"
+ The web time machine ?!
+ Knowledge Conservancy Magic Triangle
# checkout : HAL archives-ouvertes

** "The Turing Way"
+ Start by adding a licence
+ Start a README file
+ Identify your Contributors
+ ~Check "CDT" (Credits) : 14 contributor roles
  - conceptualization, ressources, etc.
  - look at the examples for the research projects 

** TODO exercice with R : first name

* Next week
- ggplot
- using git with "big data" !? (is that a thing ?!)
* R 
** Dependencies
*** "tidyverse" needs
- install.packages("zeallot")
- sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
- sudo apt install libsodium-dev
- sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
- sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev

*** "ggpubr" needs 
- sudo apt-get install r-cran-rcppeigen
  - if doesn't work, run :
    - sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
    - [then, try again]
