** Homework Reveiw : footSize = f (mistakes)  
- *Bar plots* are be mainly used for catefories. Example : A, B, C, etc.
- *Mltiplying pictures*  visualization is inevitable. One must then select the few good ones.
- *Inference* : split the photo into two ; the original data + prediction plot (linear regression for example).
- *Correlation Vs. Causation* : which test to run in order to be verified ?
- *Message* : One must think about the message behind the plot ; choices must be made.
- *Confidence Interval* !
- Which *precision* ?
- Think about how to share data ! The best might be a *csv* file format. Alternatives : *json*, *yaml*.
- Make things *explicit* as much as possible.  Otherwise, bad things might happen.
- Choose the *type of variables* (features) in the data set.
- Pay attention to the *semantics* of the variables : range, missing values, etc.
  + example : 0.0 Vs. NaN (Not a Number), NA (Not Available)
- Pay attention to the *types* with respect to the used *proramming language*. 
- Knowing the NA is super important to *compute the mean*, etc.

** R Tutorial
- *Regular Expressions* are our friend !
- Provides many possible operations to export data.
- Available data frames : *mtcars*.
- *library(dplyr)* : provide tools for efficiently manipulate datasets in R.
- With Rstudio we can build *Rmd* Markdown documentation.
*** Example of data exploration in  R
#+BEGIN_src R
mtcars$mpg + 2
mean(mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 20 & cars$carb==4,]$wt)
#+END_src
*** Remarks about R
- It is a bit strange ; R have acces to the name of the variable !! Not ever seen in any other langauage.
- R is more functional than Python (which is more declarative/iterative)
*** Good practices when using R
- Troncate computation ; know when/where to save milestones in calculation.
- Allways comment the choices that are made ; when filtering, creating virtual data groups, etc.
- Pay attention to the semantics.

** Open Science mouvement
- https://www.go-fair.org : an international non-profit initiative
  + Open access, open data, open code, 
  + Reprocucibility
-  Merkle trees, Merkle DAG
-  How does git work ?
-  Finding archived public code from github on "software heritage"
-  The web time machine ?!
-  Knowledge Conservancy Magic Triangle
# checkout : HAL archives-ouvertes
*** Useful notions & tools
- digital object identifier ("doi") !
- "binder" ! : the idea of docker merged with github.
  + also useful for inspection / letting others be capable of running my code. (Vs. Jupyter).
- using *git* with *big data* !?

** "The Turing Way"
- Start by adding a licence
- Start a README file
- Identify your Contributors 
# Check "CDT" (Credits) : 14 contributor roles
- conceptualization, ressources, etc.
# look at the examples for the research projects

** Data Management
- What is a research data ?
- Data Management Plan
- Personal Data ?
  + _Directly_ or _Indireclty_ identifying the person  
- Sensitive Personal Data ?
  + can be used to cause harm to someone
  + processing these data is forbidden
*** Data Management Plan
- written document to discribe manythings..
- Motivation : FAIR Data (previous lectures), conduct time-efficient research, etc.
- Time efficiency : Time for making the DMP -> time spent making the research reproducible
  + Effect : illustration : correlation between sharing data & citation rate
- Other reason : Funding
  + the funding organisations require a DMP
- DMP is meant to be updated throughout the research project !
**** Relevant aspects of data management
- to be considered from the ...
- Writing DMP
  + by hand + tools that help doing that
**** CORE aspects of the DMP
- Data desciption and collection or re-use of existing data
- Documentation & data quality
- Storage and backup during the research process
- Legal and ethical requirements, codes of conduct
  + Responsabilities (*DPO* : Data-Protection-Officer, etc.)
  + Data minimazation
  + Privacy by default
- Data sharing and long-term preservation
  + Find a relevant repository ($)
  + Zenodo, HAL, Software Heritage : for long term preservation
  + Choose the right license
- Data management responsibilities and ressources
**** How to evaluate a DMP ?

** Comments on FirstNames Exercice using R
- To plot the departments related data, maybe it's a good idea to use a map.
- Before working with the data, explore its content first
- Before using the data, ask about its origin first
- replace "xx", and "xxxx" with NA.
- useful operations to explore the data : the begaining and the end
#+BEGIN_SRC R
first_elemnts <- head(FirstNames)
last_elements <- FirstNames %>% tail(n=20)
#+END_SRC

- The problem with _PRENOMS_RARES category : we must read the documentation from producer
- Identifying the portion of missing values, and compare it with the size of the data (to have an idea)
- Some names are the same but with special characters (accents for example).
  + Example : CELINE Vs. CÃ©LINE
- A good first step is to capitalize all names !
- measure of dispersion (diversity) of first names
- maybe gathering other historical events might be interesting to conclude potential causation !!
- The idea of "the theory of bug replacement ! ^^"

- Questions to answer about *DATA PRODUCTION*
  1. Why this dataset had been produced ? (puspose) 
  2. Which approach has been used ? (method)
  3. How this dataset has been practically produced ? (observations)
- Take time to analyse the production process
- Take time to build serious metadata document
- Take time to identify the response/explanatory variables

- About the gender : today the gender is not only binary. So, maybe we can update the data !?
- Why not add/not add the skin color !

- Define a *DATA PRODUCTION PROCESS*

- Criteria for the quality of data (from EuroStat)
  + Relevance
  + Accuracy
  + Timeliness : the time when the experiment was done, may affect the results (example : amazon survey, in the morning vs. at night : the peoples' responses might be different depending on those)
  + Compatibility
  + Coherence
  + Accessibility
  + Interpretability
  + Unicity
  + Conformity to Norm
  + Consistency

- Pre-processing of Data
  + and report the method that has been used
