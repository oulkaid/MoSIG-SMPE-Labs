** Homework Reveiw : footSize = f (mistakes)  
- *Bar plots* are be mainly used for catefories. Example : A, B, C, etc.
- *Mltiplying pictures*  visualization is inevitable. One must then select the few good ones.
- *Inference* : split the photo into two ; the original data + prediction plot (linear regression for example).
- *Correlation Vs. Causation* : which test to run in order to be verified ?
- *Message* : One must think about the message behind the plot ; choices must be made.
- *Confidence Interval* !
- Which *precision* ?
- Think about how to share data ! The best might be a *csv* file format. Alternatives : *json*, *yaml*.
- Make things *explicit* as much as possible.  Otherwise, bad things might happen.
- Choose the *type of variables* (features) in the data set.
- Pay attention to the *semantics* of the variables : range, missing values, etc.
  + example : 0.0 Vs. NaN (Not a Number), NA (Not Available)
- Pay attention to the *types* with respect to the used *proramming language*. 
- Knowing the NA is super important to *compute the mean*, etc.

** R Tutorial
- *Regular Expressions* are our friend !
- Provides many possible operations to export data.
- Available data frames : *mtcars*.
- *library(dplyr)* : provide tools for efficiently manipulate datasets in R.
- With Rstudio we can build *Rmd* Markdown documentation.
*** Example of data exploration in  R
#+BEGIN_src R
mtcars$mpg + 2
mean(mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 20 & cars$carb==4,]$wt)
#+END_src
*** Remarks about R
- It is a bit strange ; R have acces to the name of the variable !! Not ever seen in any other langauage.
- R is more functional than Python (which is more declarative/iterative)
*** Good practices when using R
- Troncate computation ; know when/where to save milestones in calculation.
- Allways comment the choices that are made ; when filtering, creating virtual data groups, etc.
- Pay attention to the semantics.

** Open Science mouvement
- https://www.go-fair.org : an international non-profit initiative
  + Open access, open data, open code, 
  + Reprocucibility
-  Merkle trees, Merkle DAG
-  How does git work ?
-  Finding archived public code from github on "software heritage"
-  The web time machine ?!
-  Knowledge Conservancy Magic Triangle
# checkout : HAL archives-ouvertes
*** Useful notions & tools
- digital object identifier ("doi") !
- "binder" ! : the idea of docker merged with github.
  + also useful for inspection / letting others be capable of running my code. (Vs. Jupyter).
- using *git* with *big data* !?

** "The Turing Way"
- Start by adding a licence
- Start a README file
- Identify your Contributors 
# Check "CDT" (Credits) : 14 contributor roles
- conceptualization, ressources, etc.
# look at the examples for the research projects
