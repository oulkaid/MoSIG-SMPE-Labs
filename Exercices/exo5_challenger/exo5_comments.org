* Wrong things with the document
The first mistake that have been made in the analysis of the presented data is removing the experiments where no malfunction occured. 
In fact, removing data is literally introducing bias into it, thus ending up with faulty conclusions.

Another error was made by removing samples based on some "opinions", 
especially when they are not reasonable.

The data that was adopted is not representative, 
and it is very hard to come up with conclusions.

* Good things with the document
The context of the data was well introduced.

The overall structure of the document is good.
